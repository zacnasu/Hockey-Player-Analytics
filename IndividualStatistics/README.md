# Individual Statistics

This directory contains two scripts, "dataParser.c" and "indStatistics.R". "dataParser.c" parses the data files in the data directory and them outputs the data to a file named "output.R" which can be read as an R script. After "output.R" is read as a script, "indStatistics.R" can then also be read as a script to output the necessary graphs to add to player reports.  The player reports can be found in the endProduct directory.


<h3>Future Improvements</h3>

Some future improvements that can be made are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate "dataParser.c" and "output.R" and put everything into one script</li>
<li>Create rMarkdown files for each player for a cleaner look</li>
</ul>
